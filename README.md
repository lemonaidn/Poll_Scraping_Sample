# Poll_Scraping_Sample
Sample of code used to scrape data from a popular polling aggregator.

This web scraper was one small component of a larger project analyzing RCP's methodology for poll exclusion/inclusion in their main Presidential Poll Aggregator. The overall project revealed a number of inconsistencies and questions about RCP's choices/objectives, and highlighted the need for a more transparent methodology.

Ask me for more details on the results of this analysis -- I would love to give you the full presentation!
